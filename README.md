This web app: **This is a simulation of a flashcard system which can be used for studying Japanese.**

Time spent: **10.4** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Anything related to styling an image is a nuissence
- Writing code before having a plan of the structures I'd need turned out to create inconviniences later, as I've had to update function calls / references later. An example includes assuming a deck of 
cards would just be a list, instead of a structure that holds card name & description.
